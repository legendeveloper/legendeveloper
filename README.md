Hi there, this is Omer aka legend developer. I'm living in Turkey.

In the last 3 years, I have constantly improved myself by learning different programming languages. In return for this service, I started to work in various projects and I still continue these studies. I'm trying to do more with some work in web design (frontend, backend) and game mode development. I aim to report the alternative and useful functions in the languages I use within the account and the source codes of the studies that I do not use.

The languages I'm dealing with are:

● C# (Visual Studio Version)

● Lua (Version 5.1, 5.2, 5.3)

● Java (For Android Programming)
 
 
  
   

Do you want to work with me?
